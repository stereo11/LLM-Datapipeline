# LLM-Datapipeline
This project, developed during Sonali Choudhary's internship at Armada IQ, builds a solution to process unstructured data into structured formats using Large Language Models (LLMs). The app, with a Python backend and Streamlit frontend, allows clients to upload PDFs, images, and text files and generates structured tabular outputs and key KPIs.
