# LLM-Datapipeline
This project focuses on building a solution to process unstructured data into structured, actionable formats using Large Language Models (LLMs). Developed during my internship at Armada IQ, the app includes a Python backend and a Streamlit frontend, enabling clients to upload PDFs, images, and text files to generate structured outputs and key KPIs.
